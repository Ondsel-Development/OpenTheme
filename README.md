OpenLight/OpenDark Theme Preference Pack for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org)

This is a set of light and dark color-impaired accessible aesthetically pleasing themes (OpenLight and OpenDark) for FreeCAD based on the [Open-Color Palette](https://github.com/yeun/open-color) that is WCAG/APCA compliant.

I have refactored this theme for improved maintainability using SCSS. New color variants can be created easily without having to re-style the entire spreadsheet. I compile the stylesheets using [QTSASS](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtsass).

## Installation

Using [Preference Packs](https://wiki.freecad.org/Preference_Packs) requires FreeCAD 0.20 or higher.

Preference Packs should be installed via the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons), but can be [installed manually](https://wiki.freecad.org/Preference_Packs#Distributing_a_pack) if required.
